  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>[I am currently in the 12th grade at Bancroft School, a small private school in Worcester, MA. In my pastime I enjoy playing golf, tennis, and basketball with my friends. I was born on March 20th, 2000, and I moved to Massachussetts from Michigan when I was 2 months old.]</p>

  <h3>Favorite Songs and Bands</h3>
  [Unlike many other kids, there is not one genre of music that I prefer over other genres. Some of my favorite artists would probably be the following: ACDC, Florida Georgia Line, Eminem, 21 Savage, Drake.]
  <h3>Favorite Books </h3>
  [Personally, when I was young boy I enjoyed reading books about Adventure. I currently do not read as much as I used to however, I read the news every single day on my Ipad, and I have made it my goal for the year to read more books.]

  <h3>What I Like To Do in My Spare Time</h3>
  [In my spare time I enjoy playing video games with my friends and playing sports with my brothers.]
